Step 1: put all the original datasets under the folder ./datasets from the current code location

Step 2 Data preprocessing: preprocessing.ipynb
	run all the cells, the output files for both training and testing images are stored as: 
	../datasets/train_images_preprocessed.npy
	../datasets/test_images_preprocessed.npy

To run SVM: SVM.ipynb
	run all the cells

To run KNN: KNN.ipynb
	run all the cells

To run CNN: CNN_Final-tflearn.ipynb
	run all the cells. The best parameter settings are all presented in the report.

To  run NN:
