### Team: Bernoudles

### Step 1:
Put all original datasets under the folder ./datasets from the current code location

### Step 2: 
Data preprocessing: preprocessing.ipynb
	run all the cells, the output files for both training and testing images are stored as: 
	../datasets/train_images_preprocessed.npy
	../datasets/test_images_preprocessed.npy

### Step 3:
To run SVM: SVM.ipynb
	run all the cells

To run KNN: KNN.ipynb
	run all the cells

To run CNN: CNN_Final-tflearn.ipynb
	run all the cells. The best parameter settings are all presented in the report.

To run NN:
